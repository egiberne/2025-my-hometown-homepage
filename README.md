# Recap

Iâ€™m grateful to have started the Hometown Homepage, applying key web development techniques to build a clean and accessible layout:

- [x] Used **classes** and **IDs** to define element properties  
- [x] Applied `background-color` and `background` styles to enhance visual design  
- [x] Controlled layout using **Flexbox** for responsive structure  
- [x] Structured content with semantic **sections** and **tables**  
- [x] Adjusted **margin** and **padding** to improve spacing and center elements  
- [x] Followed a **color palette** for accessibility and visual harmony  
- [x] Reviewed the design using **Figma** for layout consistency  
- [x] Included **Google Fonts** for improved typography  
- [ ] Custom styling and content for my own hometown â€” coming soon!
